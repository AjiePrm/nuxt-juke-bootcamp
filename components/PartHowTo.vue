                    Arrange the burgers on a plate. Cover them with plastic wrap or wax paper. Chill for 30 minutes to a few hours to make the burgers firmer and easier to cook. Burger meat is best cooked cold.

                    Choose your cooking method. The homemade burgers can be cooked with a broiler or grill, fried in the skillet or frying pan, or barbecued. They can also be baked. The method used depends on what you have available and what you prefer by way of taste and texture. Whichever method you choose, after taking the patties out of the fridge, spritz them with a little cooking oil or brush them with some melted butter before cooking. Here are the different methods you can use:
                <ul class="text-gray-100 mt-5 list-disc">
                    <li>Broiler/grill: Preheat the broiler (upper level grill) to medium heat. Line a broiler pan with foil, for easier cleanup after cooking. Place the burgers in the broiler pan. Broil them for 6-7 minutes on each side or until thoroughly cooked.</li>
                    <li>Frying pan or skillet: Add oil or butter to the pan and fry the burgers well. Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through.</li>
                    <li>Place the burgers on the barbecue grill. Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue.</li>
                    <li>Bake: Place in the oven on 350ºF/180ºC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness. You may like to flip them over halfway, testing doneness regularly.</li>
                </ul>

                    While the burgers are cooking, prepare the toppings. You can choose to use whatever toppings you like, but here's what you can do to prepare traditional toppings for the burger:
                    <ul class="text-gray-100 mt-5 list-disc">
                        <li>Wash the lettuce and tomatoes.</li>
                        <li>Halve the burger buns, then thinly slice the tomatoes.</li>
                        <li>Place the ketchup and mayonnaise on the table for diners to make their own choice.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

                    Serve. Once the burgers are cooked to each diner's liking, serve the burgers. Place inside the bun with the toppings and deliver to the table.
                    <ul class="text-gray-100 mt-5 list-disc">
                        <li>Alternatively, place the burger on a plate with other food such as rice, chips, mashed potato, or salad.</li>
                    </ul>
